## Download / Usage

Stable builds can be downloaded at: [https://github.com/skylersaleh/SkyEmu/releases](https://github.com/skylersaleh/SkyEmu/releases)

Dev builds can be found here:

[Windows](https://nightly.link/skylersaleh/SkyEmu/workflows/deploy_win/dev/WindowsRelease.zip) | [MacOS](https://nightly.link/skylersaleh/SkyEmu/workflows/deploy_mac/dev/MacOSRelease.zip) | [Linux](https://nightly.link/skylersaleh/SkyEmu/workflows/deploy_linux/dev/LinuxRelease.zip) | [FreeBSD](https://nightly.link/skylersaleh/SkyEmu/workflows/deploy_freebsd/dev/FreeBSDRelease.zip) | [Android](https://nightly.link/skylersaleh/SkyEmu/workflows/deploy_android/dev/AndroidRelease.zip) | 
[iOS](https://nightly.link/skylersaleh/SkyEmu/workflows/deploy_ios/dev/iOSRelease.zip)





The latest stable version of the emulator can also be played without installing at the following address as a progressive web app:

[https://web.skyemu.app/](https://web.skyemu.app/)

Alternatively, you can use the [dev version](https://web.skyemu.app/branch/dev) for testing new features.

On Mobile platforms, it is recommended to add this to the home screen and launch from there. This will prevent the web browser from auto deleting save files and will make the app full screen. 

Note: Platform BIOS/Firmware files are not required, as SkyEmu bundles open source replacement BIOS/stubs. However, it is strongly recommended to dump official BIOS/firmware as the open source replacements lack many of the features of the native firmware/BIOS (such as colorizing GB games and the startup splashes) and are not as accurate.

## Loading save files and BIOSs

On web builds save files and the BIOS can be loaded by dragging them onto the page or loading them using the ROM file picker. The GBA BIOS must be named `gba_bios.bin` for the emulator to pick it up. Save files must be named the name of the rom file with the extension `.sav`. So for example if the ROM was `MyRomFile.gba` the save file must be called `MyRomFile.sav`. 

On native builds the above naming convention still applies, but the save/BIOS files must be instead located in the same folder as the ROM file, instead of being dragged or loaded in the emulator itself.

## Native Build Instructions

Native builds are experimental currently but can be built using the following commands:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. 
cmake --build . 
```

The output binaries should be in the build/bin folder

Native builds support loading roms through the command line by specifying the path to the ROM as the first argument: 

```
./SkyEmu path/to/rom.gba
```
